# Visualizing the Evolution of the NBA 3-Point Shot

## Description
This repository contains files for my blog post about how the use of the NBA 3-point line has evolved since its introduction. The post [can be viewed here](https://anaspiringsportsnerd.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/the-evolution-of-the-3-point-shot/).

## Usage
* The folder `plots` contains the image files for every plot.
* `scoring_evolution_vis.twb` is the Tableau workbook with all plots, other explored plots, and some interactive mouseover elements. I felt the mouseover effects weren't necessary in this post.

## Notes
* Visualizing this data showed me new problems in the original web scraping script further explained in its repository.

## Credits
* All data scraped from basketball-reference.com
* [Repository of web scraping script used](https://github.com/SpecCRA/nba_data_scrapers)

## Technology used
* [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/)
